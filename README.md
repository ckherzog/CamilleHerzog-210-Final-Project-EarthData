# CamilleHerzog-210-Final-Project-EarthData

In this project I attempted to use SYB65_1_202209_Population.Surface.Area.and.Density.2.csv to make a map that assigned the population of each country colors. I'll be honest, I don't understand rust and so I just tried my best. I know I should have asked for more help because this submission is nothing like the proposal I made. I over estimated my abilities and couldn't figure out what do beyond what I have completed here which I'm sure is wrong. I have accepted that I will recieve a low grade. Thank you for your time and I apologize for this work.
